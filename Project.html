                <h3>Design of a Wearable Flexible Piezoresistive Strain Sensor</h3>
                <p>This paper takes the design of flexible piezoresistive sensor and the construction of wearable application system as the research topic. On the basis of understanding and mastering the basic principle and realization method of flexible piezoresistive strain sensor, the pressure sensor is produced by using functional material and substrate material, and the corresponding function display is carried out on the VC interface with STM32 single chip microcomputer. Emphasis is placed on the preparation techniques and pressing of PDMS/CNT composites Resistance effect, how to use STM32 single chip computer,  MFC equipped with detection system, etc.</p>
                <p>Finally, the flexible material is determined to be sponge structure and this sensor is used in "the elderly fall alarm" system.</p>

                <h3>For Chip Level Cooling System:Microchannel cooling system</h3>
                <p>After the 'Microsystems Integration Technology' course, we students are asked to design a cooling system, which consists of a  resistor(to stimulate heat source), microchannel and temperature sensors(for the performance test). The specific work is as follows.</p>
                <p>1.Simulate solid - heat and solid-liquid coupling field based on COMSOL;</p>
                <p>2. Explore the optimal microchannel structure through simulation;</p>
                <p>3. Integrate the whole microsystem with heat source and microchannel and design the tests for heat dispersion performan</p>

                <h3>Multi-function environment monitoring system based on Single Chip Microcomputer</h3>
                <p>The SCM develop work based on Keil C51, including Design the circuit diagram, weld the electric circuit and program required functions, like temperature and light monitoring, alarm and the data interface upload.</p>
                <p>This monitoring system can detect the temperature, the ambient brightness, and support to reserve and change a preset value. If the sensors detect that the current value is greater than it, the system will alarm. Besides, via the serial port, the current temperature value can be sent to the PC and be done further data processing.</p>

                <h3>Material sorting control system based on PLC</h3>
                <p>The main function of this system is to select the different materials(iron material and color materials)by a laser sensor and grab and transport them by controlling the mechanical arm.</p>
                <p>There are also lots of details to make the whole process stable and smooth, like using the sensor to control the run of the turnplate, issuing an alarm, and changing the state when the materials run out or other problems happen.</p>
                <p>In addition, we design the interactive interface for this system to complete the manipulate and process visualization. </p>
